#What is this?
A scryfall image downloader I made to practice working with LuaSec, apis, and coroutines.
Not really meant for actual use, but could be convenient for something.

#Usage
Should be compatible with Lua 5.1-5.3 and LuaJIT.
To use just run it from a command line with search terms as arguments
```
$ lua scryfallImageDownload.lua "once upon a time" "sliver queen"
```

Or make the file executable
```
$ chmod +x scryfallImageDownload.lua
$ ./scryfallImageDownload.lua "gilded goose" "gideon blackblade" "food chain"
```
